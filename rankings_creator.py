# use elo to help user generate rankings from pairwise comparisons
# 1) Rank everyone using weighted (closestNRanks + ADP from popular websites)
# 2) Ask user to compare everyone with the same predicted rank to fix tie breakers
#    (maybe use other ranks as extra tiebreakers or show info on screen)
# 3) Show user information about last years performance (+ machine learning model to predict next year's performance?) and let them decide
# 4) Show final ranks at end and let them adjust
